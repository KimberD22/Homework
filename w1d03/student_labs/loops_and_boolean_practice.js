//Afternoon lab Intro to Pseudo-Coding
//EQUATOR DRIVE 
//How much would it cost to drive around the world at he equator
//create a calculator to get the cost 
/*find equator miles or total distance of trip (24,000) 
take total distance and divide by miles per gallon (15 mpg)
this gives number of gallons needed 
Multiply the number of gallons needed by gas prices per gallon
*/

//Hungry for More? Sandwich
/* create variables for each sandwich element 
variable = bread, peanut butter, jelly
give each of the variables a number, perferably in order of assembly
create an array
print out array in order of assembly 
bread
peanut butter
jelly 
bread 
if array prints in correct order 
print out enjoy your sandwich */
